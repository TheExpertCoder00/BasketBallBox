# 🏀 BasketballBox

**BasketballBox** is a 3D multiplayer basketball game built with **Three.js** and **WebSockets**, where two players can compete 1v1 in real-time. You control your player in first-person view and use real basketball moves — dribble, shoot, dunk, block, and more.

**Public repo updates are paused to protect secret keys. The game itself will keep getting updates until August 31, our final release**
